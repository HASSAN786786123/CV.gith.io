    <h1>What Is The Perfect Paragraph?</h1>
    <p>
        As designers, we are frequently and incorrectly reminded that our job is
        to “make things pretty.” We are indeed designers — not artists — and there
        is no place for formalism in good design. Web design has a function, and
        that function is to communicate the message for which the Web page was
        conceived. The medium is not the message.
    </p>

    <h2>THE TYPEFACE </h2>
    <p>Your choice of font is important, but the kind of “family” you choose is project-specific, and we won’t discuss
        it here except to make one point: the conventional wisdom among Web designers that only sans-serif fonts are
        suitable for body text is just a rule of thumb. Although serif fonts, with their greater complexity, may tend to
        be less effective at small sizes, there are many other factors to consider. A diminutive x-height, for example,
        could impair the readability of a font from either camp. Some serif fonts are highly legible and attractive for
        paragraph text if they are set properly. Matthew Carter’s screen-sympathetic Georgia is a case in point.</p>
